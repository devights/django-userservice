To use this - add this to your setting.py's INSTALLED_APPS:

    'userservice',

And this to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:

    'userservice.user.UserServiceMiddleware',                                   


This project uses authz_group to control access to the user override app.  If you want to use that app, add this to your project/urls.py:


and this to your setting.py:

    AUTHZ_GROUP_BACKEND = 'authz_group.authz_implementation....'           
    USERSERVICE_ADMIN_GROUP = '... group name ...' 

If you want to allow anyone to be able to override - and don't do that in production - you can use this:

    AUTHZ_GROUP_BACKEND = 'authz_group.authz_implementation.all_ok.AllOK'           


With all of that in place, request.user will be either the actual user, or the user you are impersonating.  To get more information about the current user, you can use:

    user_service = UserService() 
    
    # This is the logged in user's name:
    user_service.get_original_user()
    
    # This is the override user:
    user_service.get_override_user()

    # This will be the override user if it exists, the logged in user otherwise:
    user_service.get_user()
